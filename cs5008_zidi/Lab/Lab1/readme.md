I work by myself.
I have browsed some youtube video explaining OS and some installation tutorial.
I have spent almost 5 hours to finish all the turtials, installation and lab assignments.
I love how this lab is so detailed and there are step by step instructions to help me understanding computer systema and getting familiar with it.
I am very new to computer system so I feel a bit owerwhelming first time in the lab.
